## Weather App

- Simple weather app made using OpenWeatherAPI
- current api-key is a mock one(but since it is a free API survice, just go and get yours at <http://api.openweathermap.org>)
- The app currently shows: Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, percentage Humidity, and a brief description. The background colour changes tone according to the kind of weather. 
- might add corresponding weather icons later on.

### Dependencies:
- python
- tkinter
- pillow
  (icons might be added in future)
- requests
